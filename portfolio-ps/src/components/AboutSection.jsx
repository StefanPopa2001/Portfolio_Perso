              I’m Stefan Popa, a 24-year-old software developer. I was born in Romania and have lived in Belgium since I was seven. Growing up in the early 2000s computer era, I started exploring the realms of Windows 95 and XP.

              Before starting my bachelor’s degree, I taught myself video editing, one of my hobbies, and began working as a freelance video editor in my free time. This early experience helped me develop the qualities that define me most today: patience, entrepreneurship, self-learning, and communication.

              My first bachelor’s degree at HELHa Mons sparked my curiosity for clean code practices and software architecture. My end-of-studies internship at Aproove further expanded my belief that code should be written first for other developers, and that architecture should limit or eliminate technical debt.

              My love for software and hardware led me to pursue a second bachelor’s degree in Industrial Computing at HELHa Charleroi. These studies have given me a deeper understanding of how our connected world works.
